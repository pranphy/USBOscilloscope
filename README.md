# USB Oscilloscope

This is a haphazard collection of everything that is there in a small project
called the USB Oscilloscope. The electrical signal is collected processed and
sent to computer and displayed in a gui window as waveform.

The results were satisfactory for signals of fairly low frequency when I  had
the hold of hardware. Now I don't have the hardware its lost somewhere  in my
blissful room. 

This is for rererence.

I am planning to add some of the snapshots of the waveform taken later if  and
when I find them around my computer in this file.

Enjoy !! :D
