\abstract{This is the final report of out Project USB Oscilloscope. After three months of explorations and hard work, we are at a point where we can observe the waveforms of continuous time varying input signals on the PC screen.

First the input analog signal was sampled and the analog to digital conversion was done. Atmega16 microcontroller and the ADC availabe within the same microcontroller is used for this purspose. Then the digital values were sent to the PC via USB following the USB protocol. The program required for microcontorller was written in C++ programming language and was compiled using avr-gcc compiler.

 The digital data was read PC and was converted back to analog values and plotted in graph as a function of time. The software interface required to display the waveform was was built in C++ programmig language using wxWidget API, in our own native style as per the contextual requirement.

Now our system is able to read the input signals. send them to PC. and the PC displays them as a function of time which is exactly the waveform shown by the oscilloscope.\\
